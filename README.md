You are required to find a dataset (can be from the Datasets folder in courseworks or the dataset of your choice), and think of a research question. Afterwards, you are required to use hypothesis testing to answer your research question.

You must include the following components in your final paper:
1. Research question
2. Background information
3. Hypothesis tests
4. Results of your hypothesis tests in plain English
5. Visuals
6. Overall conclusion (what were you able to find from your hypothesis tests?)
7. References
